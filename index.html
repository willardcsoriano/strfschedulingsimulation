        <ul>
            <li><b>Job</b>: Unique identifier for each job/process in the simulation.</li>
            <li><b>Arrival Time</b>: Time at which each job arrives in the system. In this simulation, jobs arrive at random times between 1 and 7.</li>
            <li><b>Burst Time</b>: Total time required for each job to complete execution, randomly assigned between 1 and 10.</li>
            <li><b>Completion Time</b>: Time at which each job finishes its execution. Calculated as:
                <br><code>Completion Time = Turnaround Time + Arrival Time</code></li>
            <li><b>Turnaround Time</b>: Total time taken from the arrival of the job to its completion. Calculated as:
                <br><code>Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time</code></li>
            <li><b>Waiting Time</b>: Total time a job spends waiting in the queue to be executed. Calculated as:
                <br><code>Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time</code></li>

        <h2>SRTF Scheduling Algorithm Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            The Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) scheduling algorithm is a preemptive version of the Shortest Job Next (SJN) scheduling. It always selects the job with the shortest remaining time to execute next. If a new job arrives with a shorter burst time than the remaining time of the current job, the current job is preempted, and the new job is executed.
        </p>
        <p>Steps in the Algorithm:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Initialization</b>: At time 0, all jobs arrive in the system.</li>
            <li><b>Job Selection</b>: The algorithm selects the job with the shortest remaining burst time.</li>
            <li><b>Execution</b>: The selected job is executed for one time unit.</li>
            <li><b>Preemption Check</b>: If a new job arrives with a shorter burst time, it preempts the current job.</li>
            <li><b>Completion Check</b>: If a job completes its execution, its completion time is recorded.</li>
            <li><b>Repeat</b>: Steps 2-5 are repeated until all jobs are completed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This approach ensures that the job with the shortest remaining time gets executed first, minimizing the waiting time and improving the overall efficiency of the system.
