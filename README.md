# SRTF Scheduling Simulation

This repository contains a web-based simulation of the Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) scheduling algorithm. The simulation generates 100 jobs with random burst times and arrival times and displays the results in a tabular format. Users can sort the results based on various criteria such as Job ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time.

## Features

- Generates 100 jobs with random burst times (1-10) and arrival times (1-7).
- Implements the SRTF scheduling algorithm.
- Displays simulation results in a sortable table.
- Allows sorting by Job ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time.
